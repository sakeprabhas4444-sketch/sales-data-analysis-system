# Sales Data Analysis System

Flask + Pandas/NumPy/Matplotlib + MySQL backend, Bootstrap/vanilla-JS frontend (served by the backend).

## Run (Windows PowerShell; macOS/Linux: use `source venv/bin/activate` and `cp`)
```powershell
cd backend
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass   # only if activation is blocked
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env      # then edit .env and set DB_PASSWORD (or leave DB_ENGINE=auto)
python app.py               # open http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
The database `sales_analysis` and its tables are created automatically on first start (MySQL must be running).
Try it: **Import CSV** tab -> upload `backend/sample_data/sales_sample.csv` (189 rows: 180 good, 2 duplicates, 7 malformed).

### MySQL password - where to get it
It is the **root password you chose when you installed MySQL** (MySQL Installer -> "Accounts and Roles"); it is not stored anywhere you can look it up.
Put it in `backend/.env` as `DB_PASSWORD=...`. Test it with `mysql -u root -p` or MySQL Workbench (the saved "Local instance" connection).
Forgot it? Reset it (MySQL Installer -> Reconfigure, or the MySQL docs "Resetting the root password"), or ignore MySQL:
with the default `DB_ENGINE=auto` the app prints the problem and **falls back to SQLite automatically**. Use `DB_ENGINE=mysql` to force MySQL only.
Try it: **Import CSV** tab -> upload `backend/sample_data/sales_sample.csv` (189 rows: 180 good, 2 duplicates, 7 malformed).

## Tests
`cd backend && python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (temporary SQLite DB; covers revenue maths, malformed rows, duplicate policy, CRUD, filters, charts).

## Duplicate-import policy
A sale's identity is **product name + sale date + quantity + unit price + region** (case-insensitive), stored as a SHA-1 `row_hash` with a UNIQUE index.
A row matching an earlier row in the same file or any earlier import is skipped and reported (`duplicate_in_file` / `duplicate_existing`); the rest of the file is still imported.
Manually added sales are exempt (genuine repeat sales are allowed). Deleting a sale lets it be re-imported. Existing product category wins over a CSV's category.

## Validation
Whole file rejected if: not UTF-8, empty, or a required column is missing. Per row (skipped + reported with line number and reason): wrong column count, empty product/category/region,
invalid or future date (YYYY-MM-DD, DD-MM-YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY), quantity not a whole number > 0, unit price not a number or negative. Full report downloadable as CSV.

## Revenue accuracy
Revenue = quantity x unit price computed in integer paise/cents with NumPy (no float drift). Monthly growth % = (month - previous) / previous; shown as "–" when the previous month had no revenue.

## API (JSON)
`POST /api/import` · `GET /api/imports` · `GET /api/imports/<id>/report.csv` · `GET|POST /api/products` · `DELETE /api/products/<id>` · `GET|POST /api/sales` · `DELETE /api/sales/<id>`
`GET /api/analytics/{summary,products,monthly,categories,regions}` and `GET /api/charts/{monthly,products}.png` (filters: `start,end,category,region`).
